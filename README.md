**Project Overview:**

The students (Total of 624 students across 6 sections) are grouped into teams and tasked with managing virtual coffee shops in the simulation. Each week, they make decisions that impact the performance of their coffee shops. The system provides real-time insights into their progress based on key metrics, such as shop revenue, employee efficiency, income, and customer satisfaction.

**Features:**

Interactive Dashboards: Created using Tableau, these dashboards allow students and the professor to monitor performance metrics for each team every week.

Web Integration: The Tableau dashboards are integrated with a web application, making the system easily accessible for both students and the professor to track performance by industry.

**Access:**

The system is designed to be easily used by all students and the professor. Those interested in exploring the system can access it using the following credentials:

**Username: external_user
